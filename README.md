## Password Generator ( Vue )

- My first Vue project! It should function as the other one made by React.

- This password generator creates random passwords based on parameters set by users.  
  Parameters include password length (limit of 4 to 20), composed of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or symbols.
- Users can copy the password to clipboard by clicking on the copy icon.
- The idea was from [FLORIN POP's 100 DAYS - 100 PROJECTS CHALLENGE](https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/2019/09/100-days-100-projects/).

## Description

- Built with Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite.
